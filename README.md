## Schedule Buddy

This is a discord bot made to help Concordia students plan their schedule, or to just give general info about which semesters queried courses are offered in and general information about them.
If you would like to add this bot to your server reach out to me on discord @JohnyNoToes#5311
All it takes is permission for the bot to enter the server from the server admin and a small change in the discord_config file to add the channel id of the channel you would like the bot to exist in.
(The following is repeated in the bot's 'info' prompt).

Concordia collects all kinds of data and its Open Data project thinks it should be accessible (I do too).
Please note the data is updated daily so enrollment numbers are not live, for that check your MyConcordia My Student Center.

This bot grabs data from Concordia's Open Data project here:
